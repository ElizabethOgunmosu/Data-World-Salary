According to a survey by Glassdoor, the average base salary for a data analyst in the United States is around $67,000 per year, while a data scientist can expect to earn an average of $113,000 per year.
Data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers are some of the most sought-after roles in the industry, with salaries ranging from entry-level to six-figure salaries for experienced professionals. Without restrictions to only these three, other equivalent data roles are relevant and can land one in six-figure salaries. Companies across all industries are recognizing the value of data-driven decision-making, which is driving the demand for skilled professionals in this field.

In addition, data-driven approaches can also help to address critical social challenges such as healthcare, education, and poverty reduction, by providing insights into the needs of underserved populations and informing more effective policy interventions. By developing a strong workforce in data-related job roles, Africa can position itself to harness the power of data to drive development and improve quality of life for its citizens.
